# Send an Article Submission Request

To publish an article at [Genics Blog](https://genicsblog.com), first you would need to [create a new issue](https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.github.io/issues/new/choose) on the repository with the **Submission Request** template.

---

The issue template contains a set of questions that would ease the publishing process for us.

### Idea

In this space you can describe what topic you want to write an article on and other general information you would like to share with us.

### Topics

This section asks you to list the primary **Category** and the **Tags** this post would belong to. **You can propose new categories and tags!**

Remember, **a post can have only 1 Category and a maximum of 3 tags**(exemptions can be made, please [contact us](https://genicsblog.com/contact) in such case)

### Cross-posting

If you want to share your pre-written article, please add a link to that.

### Remarks

In this section, you can share some additional information if you wish to.

---

Once you submit a request, someone from the Genics team would respond if you can start working on the initial draft of the article!
