# Send an Article Submission Request

To publish an article at [Genics Blog](https://genicsblog.com), first you would need to [create a new issue](https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.github.io/issues/new/choose) on the repository with the **Article Submission** template.

The issue template contains a set of questions that would ease the publishing process for us.

Once you submit a request, someone from the Genics team would respond if you can start working on the initial draft of the article.
